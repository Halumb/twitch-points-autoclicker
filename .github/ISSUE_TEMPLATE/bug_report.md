**Before Reporting**
Refresh your Twitch page! (I know it sounds stupid, but trust me it works.)

**If that fails, specify the version of the extension**
This can either be the main version or LITE version

**Describe the bug**
A clear and concise description of what the bug is.

**Note which logging steps are missing**
Open your browser console (F12 and navigate to "Console" tab), and look for the output from "twitch-clicker.js":
* Twitch Points Autoclicker: Initialized!
* Detected inside of a channel page.
* Element detected.
* Twitch Points Autoclicker: Clicked!

**Sometimes it might be useful to note, which browser you are using:**
 - Firefox/Chrome/Brave/etc
 - Browser Version [e.g. 22 or 74.0.3729.169]
